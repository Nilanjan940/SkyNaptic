/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for SkyNaptic Firestore database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on user roles and ownership.
 * It allows public read access to flight and alert data while restricting write access to authorized users.
 * User profiles and drones are strictly controlled by their respective owners.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /userProfiles/{userId}: Stores individual user profile data. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /flights/{flightId}: Stores flight data. Publicly readable, writeable by authorized roles (not defined in this prototype).
 * - /drones/{droneId}: Stores drone data. Only the drone operator (owner) can read/write.
 * - /alerts/{alertId}: Stores alert data. Publicly readable, writeable by authorized roles (not defined in this prototype).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied for privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to flight and alert data to facilitate visualization and data sharing.
 * - The data schema is not strictly enforced in this prototyping phase, but authorization-critical fields (e.g., operatorId in Drones) are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `drones` collection uses the `operatorId` field to link each drone to its operator's `userProfile`. This avoids the need for complex `get()` calls to determine ownership and allows for performant rules.
